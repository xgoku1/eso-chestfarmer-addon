; Changelog:
; v1.16 (27.11.2021)
; * Added auto-open Mirri boxes feature. Optional dependency on LibCustomMenu to work.
; * Iterates over inventory, finds Mirri boxes and opens them. Right-click on a Mirri box to start.
; * Edge-cases: Auto-open won't work if free inventory space <4 or if character is in combat/dead
; * Thanks to Baertram, silvereyes, Dolgubon, and Zelenin for help with code
;
; v1.15 (20.10.2021)
; * Compatibility patch for Deadlands DLC
;
; v1.14 (27.05.2021)
; * Changed logic to identify delves and public dungeons to rely on API rather than a table-check. (thanks Rednas)
; * Minor optimization
;
; v1.13 (19.05.2021)
; * Added support for tracking chest quality. Now use slash command 
;   "/cf stats" or press the GUI button to see total chests opened,
;   quality % across Master, Advanced, Intermediate, and Simple.
;   For users updating from v1.12 and below, the sample size will be different from 
;   your total chest count. I didn't want to affect your zone chest counts saved in 
;   savedVars, so if you want truly accurate tracking I recommend reinstalling the addon
; * Added slash-commands
;   * "/cf" -> Toggles ChestFarmer GUI
;   * "/cf reset" -> reset current zone's chest count
;   * "/cf stats" -> Historical stats, see above
; * Changed edge-case definitions and set-up ChestFarmer.Default for initial
;   set-up savedVars.
;
; v1.12 (28.04.2021)
; * Minor bugfix to savedVars definition to work as intended across servers 
;   (thanks Baertram). Unfortunately your old chest count will be reset. 
;   To migrate old chest count run the addon once, then go to 
;   ../Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/SavedVariables/ChestFarmer.lua
;   and copy-paste old values to the new table.
;
; v1.11
; * Minor bugfix
;
; v1.1
; * Added support for Blackwood zone, delves and public dungeon
;
; v1.0 (23.04.2021)
; * First release
